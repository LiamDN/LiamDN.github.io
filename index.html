              Operational decision making was the focus of the Winter 2022 Pilot interventions where academic
              success and student retention were the primary drivers. The main focus of operational decision making was
              on course design and curriculum and how we can best support academic success.
              <br><br>With intervention and retention strategies top of mind, we explored the effectiveness of the
              interventions on student success defined as receiving a passing grade or withdrawing from a course without
              academic penalty; ultimately supporting student retention.
              <br><br>By drawing on multiple sources of data, we can discover patterns and trends and look for ways to
              integrate data sets in and across a program of study, a department or Faculty, or institution-wide.

            Seeking to identify students who were in need of academic intervention, this report was generated in week 5,
            6 or 7 and built a list of learners who fell under 50% on assignments in a number of courses. The pilot
            courses were identified by Associate Deans and faculty members.<br><br>

            Student Affairs Advising contacted students with grades in the 40-50% range by email and/or phone, and those
            with a grade under 40% by email. The premise of this intervention was to use grades from SLATE to identify
            students who would benefit from advising and support services in core courses.<br><br>

            These courses included:<br><br>

            1st year courses<br><br>

            Courses where 25% of assessments were completed by week 5<br><br>

            Courses that were connected to a high level course or key course in a program<br><br>

            The goal was to connect with students while there was still time to achieve a successful grade in the
            course, or to drop the course without academic penalty.<br><br>

            One hundred and sixty-four students were identified as being ‘at risk’ over eight courses. Of those, 66
            students passed following advising, and 30 students withdrew without academic penalty. Both measures were
            indicators of program success and reflects success for 59% of the students identified at risk.<br><br>

            Program Coordinator and the tutoring center, and a credit recovery week was developed for students to study
            the content and retest in an effort to learn the material and pass the course.<br><br>

            Imagine a world where…

            <br><br>

            <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
              You can identify students at risk in every class and section you teach. You can recommend suitable
              supports
              to help guide students along the road to success. Where a student’s risk of failure is determined in
              enough
              time to redirect, before they risk their credit. Where you can identify students who were enrolled in your
              class, but shouldn’t be.<br><br>

              All of these things will be possible, as the Data Analytics & Learning Strategies program evolves. As we
              move forward in developing the D2L data analytics integration, more and more opportunity will arise to
              evaluate and support students by fostering a culture of care and support for all Sheridan students.
